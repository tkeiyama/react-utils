# React utils

This provides utils for React to develop easily.
Most utils is not ready for production.

## Installation

> In some cases, you can add this to `devDependencies`.

```
pnpm add @tkeiyama/react-utils
```

## Usage

Every utility has `README.md`. So you just pick up a utility in the `src` folder to see the usage.

## Examples

You can find examples using a utility.
Every library in the [examples](./examples) has a directory for a utility in the source code folder such as `src` or `app`.

So if you wanna see an example of the `theme` utility with `Storybook`, you just go to [examples/storybook/src/theme](./examples//storybook/src/theme).
